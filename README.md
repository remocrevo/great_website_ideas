 Great websites I don't have time to make


## A Better Dog Selling Site
(or for selling anything that requires a lot of tedious communication -- cars, large sets of something, etc.)

### Problems with current solutions
- Communication is usually via email or phone/texting
    - Seller gets many repeat inquiries, many of which are status requests, seller often ignores most inquiries
    - Low incentive for seller to update/delete their post
    - Buyer inquires to many sellers via various methods (email, call, text), hard to know which one is responding, and many never respond
    
### Unique Features to Solve Problems
- Dog seller profile
    - Can set automated events, like "make post public on 12/24/2020" (or "2 months after puppies are born")
    - Site can prompt seller for updates every 1-3 days. Easy buttons like "mark all as SOLD" and "How many left? [textbox]". If no response, can auto-unpublish the post and prompt seller to republish it
- Searchers can "follow" multiple owners and see many owners' statuses/updates at once on a dashboard, get notifications, etc.
- Killer features
    - Inquiries go through the site and add to the profile, so owner only has to answer each question once
    - Inquirers are pointed first to the previous questions/answers
